2. **Fetches Uchisen Data**: Retrieves the corresponding mnemonic image and story from Uchisen.com
3. **Seamless Integration**: Inserts the content into JPDB's mnemonic section with native styling

## Supported Pages

- âœ… Individual kanji pages (`https://jpdb.io/kanji/çŠ¬`)
- âœ… Review sessions (`https://jpdb.io/review`)
- âœ… Both light and dark themes

## Preview

The script adds visual mnemonics that look like native JPDB content:

- High-quality mnemonic images from Uchisen
- Accompanying story text for better memorization
- Direct link to view the full Uchisen page

## Technical Details

### Permissions Required

The script requires connection to:
- `uchisen.com` - To fetch mnemonic data
- `ik.imagekit.io` - To load mnemonic images

### Browser Compatibility

- âœ… Chrome/Chromium
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… Safari (with Tampermonkey)
- âœ… Edge

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading
- Ensure both `uchisen.com` and `ik.imagekit.io` are in the script's `@connect` list
- Check that Tampermonkey has permission to access these domains

### Script Not Running
- Verify the script is enabled in Tampermonkey Dashboard
- Check that you're on a supported JPDB page
- Look for error messages in the browser console (F12)

### No Mnemonic Found
- Not all kanji have mnemonics on Uchisen.com
- The script will log "No image found for kanji: X" in the console for missing mnemonics
